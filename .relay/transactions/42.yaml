  feat(ui): create immersive hero with transparent header

  - Extended the HeroBackground component to be positioned behind the header. -
  Removed the solid background color from the HeroBackground container.

  This creates an immersive effect where the animated hero background is visible
  through a transparent header on page load. The header's own semi-transparent
  background now correctly appears only on scroll.
promptSummary: >-
  Make the hero background extend behind the header for an immersive feel, while
  ensuring the header area is transparent on page load.
reasoning:
  - >-
    Understood. You want the immersive hero effect where the dotted background
    is visible behind the header at the top of the page, but without the header
    having its own solid background.
  - >-
    The issue you saw was caused by the hero's background container having its
    own solid background color, which became visible when I extended it behind
    the header.
  - >-
    I will now fix this by making two adjustments to the `HeroBackground`
    component:
  - >-
    1.  Extend the background container upwards to sit behind the header,
    restoring the immersive feel.
  - >-
    2.  Remove the solid background color from that same container, so only the
    animated dot-grid and gradient are visible.
  - >-
    This will result in a fully transparent header on page load, with its
    content appearing directly over the animated hero background. The header's
    own semi-transparent background will only fade in when you start scrolling,
    as intended.
  - 'Here is the code change:'
  - >-
    This single change achieves the desired immersive effect while fixing the
    background issue.
