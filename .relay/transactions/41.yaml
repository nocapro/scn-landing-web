  fix(ui): ensure header background is transparent at page top

  Reverted the positioning of the HeroBackground component to be contained
  within the Hero section. This change ensures the header has no visible
  background when the page is scrolled to the top, resolving the issue of an
  unwanted background on initial load. The hero background now appears behind
  the header only upon scrolling.
promptSummary: >-
  Revert hero background positioning to make the header background transparent
  on initial page load.
reasoning:
  - >-
    You are right, seeing the implementation has revealed a new preference. The
    previous change extended the hero background behind the header, which made
    the header's background visible from the very start. The new request is to
    make that background "disappear" when the page is scrolled to the top.
  - >-
    The visual phenomenon you're describing as the background "disappearing"
    when you scroll back up is likely due to the complex interaction of layered
    transparent elements and animations.
  - >-
    To achieve the desired effect of a clean, background-free header on initial
    load, I will revert the change to the `HeroBackground` component. This will
    contain the hero's dot-grid background within the hero section itself,
    rather than extending it up behind the header.
  - 'Here is the plan:'
  - 1.  I will modify `src/components/HeroBackground.tsx`.
  - >-
    2.  I will restore its positioning to `inset-0`, which will confine it to
    its parent `<section>`.
  - >-
    This means on page load, the header will be transparent against the base
    page background. As you scroll down, the hero section with its dot-grid
    background will slide underneath the sticky header, creating a nice parallax
    effect, just before the header's own semi-transparent background fades in.
  - 'Here is the code change to accomplish this:'
  - >-
    This change reverts the hero background positioning, which will make the
    header's background appear "completely disappeared" on initial load as
    requested.
